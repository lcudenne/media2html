==========

Media2Html, the html5 media player website generator.
https://sites.google.com/site/media2html/

This program generates a static standalone W3C HTML5/CSS3 website from a regular file system structure,
focusing on media files (images, audio files, video files and text files).
In each directory, a HTML file is created, embedding an audio-video player and a playlist made of all
the compatible media files found at this level. An explorer view is also proposed in order to open and
download files, as well as to navigate to the other directories. This program makes use of ExifTool and
ImageMagick. Supported html5 and flash players are jPlayer, CodeBaseHero, DewPlayer and XspfPlayer.

Media2html is a cross-platform bash script that should run on most of the Unix environments.
So far it has been tested on Mac OSX, Linux Ubuntu, Debian, and Raspberry Pi Debian.
